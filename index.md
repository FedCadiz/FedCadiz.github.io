### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5, part 1 was one of my favorite projects to work on since it was the first time we got introduced to vectors. It was fun to create and output a sandwich using what we learned with vectors and the command line. Since it was our first experience with vectors, it got me thinking about all the practical ways it can be used later on.

    Lab 5, part 3 was another favorite of mine. Here, we created a Blackjack game. Although it was quite simple, it was addicting to play since Iâ€™m already familiar playing Blackjack. Even after finishing the lab and its requirements, I was looking at other ways I could program it, which made the project overall enjoyable and one of my favorites,

* Lab 6

    Lab 6, part 1 was a favorite of mine where we created patterns in the command line. I thought this one was really interesting since it got me thinking about how this was how programmers would make pictures back in the day. Compared to now where things are actual high quality images, it gave me perspective of how the technology has evolved.
